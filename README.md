# Learning C

This repository contains my solutions and small experiments while learning the C programming language through a structured introductory course.

Course (Stepik): [https://stepik.org/course/193691/syllabus](https://stepik.org/course/193691/syllabus)

The purpose of this repo is educational: to demonstrate consistent practice with core C concepts (including pointers and memory management). This is not a production-ready project.

## Topics covered

* Variables and arithmetic
* Input/output (`printf`, `scanf`)
* Conditionals and loops
* Functions and recursion
* Arrays and strings
* Pointers and pointer arithmetic
* Dynamic memory (`malloc`, `free`)
* Structures, unions, enums
* File I/O

## Structure

* `lesson 2` ... `lesson 8` — solutions grouped by course lessons
* File names reflect task numbering inside the course platform

## Tools

* C (C99)
* GCC / Clang

## Extras (optional)

If you see a `leatning cpp` folder: it contains a few small C++ programs written as additional practice and is not the main focus of this repository.
